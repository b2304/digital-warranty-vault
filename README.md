# 🛡️ Digital Warranty Vault

A Java Spring Boot application for managing digital product warranties securely. This API-based service allows users to store, retrieve, and track product warranties with expiration alerts and multithreaded warranty reminders. Designed for modularity, scalability, and real-world production practices.

---

## 🧠 Features

- 📦 Store product and warranty information
- 👤 User registration and authentication (basic)
- ⏰ Warranty expiry alerting system (multithreaded)
- 📊 Warranty statistics endpoints
- 🛢️ MySQL integration using Liquibase for schema versioning
- 🚀 RESTful APIs with proper layered architecture
- 🧪 Unit and integration testing with JUnit and Mockito
- 🐳 Docker and Docker Compose support

## 🧪 API Endpoints (Sample)

### ✅ Users

- `POST /api/users/register` – Register a new user
- `GET /api/users/{id}` – Get user by ID

### 📦 Products & Warranty

- `POST /api/products` – Add a product with warranty
- `GET /api/products/user/{userId}` – All warranties for a user
- `GET /api/products/expiring-soon/{userId}` – Products with expiring warranty

---

## 🧠 Multithreading Use Case

A scheduled service runs daily using a thread pool to:
- Check for warranties expiring in X days
- Send alerts/reminders to users concurrently
- Designed using `ExecutorService` with graceful shutdown

---

## 🚀 Running the Project

### 📌 Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven
- Docker

### 🐳 Option 1: Dockerized

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:
- Build the Spring Boot app
- Start MySQL and initialize DB via Liquibase
- Expose API at `http://localhost:8080`

---

### 🔧 Option 2: Manual

```bash
# Start MySQL (manually or via Docker)
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Access: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

---

## 🧪 Testing

Run all unit and integration tests:

```bash
mvn test
```

---

## 📂 Liquibase Setup

- Master file: `changelog-master.xml`
- Includes:
  - `users-changelog.xml`
  - `products-changelog.xml`
  - Optional: `data-seed-changelog.xml`

To run Liquibase independently:

```bash
mvn liquibase:update
```

---

## ✨ Future Enhancements

- Add JWT-based authentication
- Email notifications for warranty expiry
- Web dashboard UI
- Role-based access
- Attach purchase receipts (file upload)
